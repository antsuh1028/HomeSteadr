            "The Swiss Data Center Efficiency Label is awarded for excellence in energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of data center infrastructures and their containing IT infrastructures. This includes three key components. The data center infrastructure award criteria apply to the entire energy flow, from ingest to output, including recycling capabilities of output energy (such as using thermal discharge to heat other buildings). The IT infrastructure award criteria apply to energy-efficient IT technology and effective IT usage. Depending on their compliance with the efficiency criteria, data centers can be awarded with a gold, silver or bronze label."

            "To build the massive datacenters generative AI requires, major companies like Amazon and Microsoft \"are going nuclear,\" reports CIO magazine .  Earlier this year, AWS paid $650 million to purchase Talen Energy's Cumulus Data Assets, a 960-megawatt nuclear-powered data center on site at Talen's Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, nuclear plant, with additional data centers planned — pending approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Agency... In addition to its purchase of the Cumulus data center, AWS will have access to nuclear energy as part of a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) from the Susquehanna site.   Last year, Constellation signed a deal giving Microsoft the rights to receive up to 35% of its power from nuclear sources in addition to its existing solar and wind purchases from Constellation for Microsoft's Boydton, Va., data center. Microsoft has also signed a nuclear carbon credits deal with Ontario Power Generation for its operations in Canada. "
